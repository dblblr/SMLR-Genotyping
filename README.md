# SMLR-Genotyping
## Temporary repository for doubleblinded review.
This repository will be transferred to a non-anonymous profile when the corresponding article ("Enhanced SNP Genotyping with Symmetric Multinomial Logistic Regression") has been reviewed and hopefully accepted for publishing.
From that profile, the new repository will be permanently stored at Zenodo and the assigned DOI will be inserted at the marked location in the article (one of the references).
After that, this temporary repository will be deleted.
